            answer: `Create or join a group, add shared expenses in seconds, and let PayTogether keep balances accurate for everyone. Add common expenses to favorites and avoid re-entering the same details repeatedly. Upload receipts to quickly capture expenses, and let group members and non-group members alike claim their items and see what they owe. When you're ready to settle up, PayTogether suggests the most efficient payments for everyone.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Is my data secure?',
            answer: `All communication with PayTogether is encrypted with HTTPS and guarded by strict access controls. Only the people you invite into a group can see its balances, and we never hand that data to outside parties.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Do all group members need accounts?',
            answer: `Anyone who wants to view and interact with the group needs an account, but you can add group members that are not linked to a user. Linking an account adds certain conveniences, like saving preferred payment methods to your profile which are automatically shown to users whenever you are owed, and the ability to view other group members' payment methods when you owe them.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Who needs PayTogether Plus?',
            answer: `PayTogether Plus is perfect for power users who want enhanced personal features. Plus subscribers get receipt scanning, guest sharing with payment method links, flexible charge splitting for taxes and tips, unlimited favorites, detailed analytics, CSV exports, and advanced search and filter capabilities.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How does receipt scanning work?',
            answer: `A Plus subscriber uploads a receipt photo and totals are automatically extracted. Next, group members and guests can use the generated links to claim their items - or you can assign items manually via dropdowns. Once everyone has claimed, you finalize the receipt and PayTogether generates a single transaction reflecting what each person owes.`

            question: 'How do guests claim items on a receipt?',
            answer: `When you share a guest link, anyone with the link can view the receipt and claim items without signing up. They'll see their total and your payment methods (Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) so they know exactly how to pay you back. You can mark guests as paid and revoke links at any time.<br><br>Note - Guest balances will not be reflected in the generated transaction as they are external to the group. For the same reason, if a guest is the receipt payer, the transaction will not be logged to the group, as it would create un-settlable balances. In this case, consider adding the payer to the group as a member, or creating a new group that includes all receipt participants.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How do charge splits work?',
            answer: `For each receipt, you can split taxes, gratuity, fees, and discounts in different ways: equally among all participants, proportionally based on subtotals, or with custom amounts per person. This gives you full control over how shared charges are allocated.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Does PayTogether support different currencies?',
            answer: `Yes! Each group has a home currency. Expenses and receipts scanned in a different currency are automatically converted using current exchange rates. The converted amounts appear alongside the original currency so everyone knows exactly what they owe.`
          },
          {
            question: 'What happens to my extra favorites if I leave Plus?',
            answer: `Your five most recently used favorites stay active. Any extras are safely stored and can be reactivated if you're within the limit. Upgrading to Plus again will restore them all automatically.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Can I export my transactions?',
            answer: `Plus members can export group data to CSV, making it simple to run reports, share with other members, or archive history.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How do I get support?',
            answer: `Drop a note to <a href="mailto:support@paytogether.io">support@paytogether.io</a> and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Do you take feature requests and feedback?',
            answer: `Absolutely! We love hearing how we can make PayTogether work better for your specific needs. Whether it's a small improvement or a big new feature idea, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:feedback@paytogether.io">feedback@paytogether.io</a>.`
