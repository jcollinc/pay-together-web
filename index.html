Add common expenses to favorites and avoid re-entering the same details repeatedly. When you're ready to settle up, PayTogether suggests the most efficient payments for everyone.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Is my data secure?',
            answer: `All communication with PayTogether is encrypted with HTTPS and guarded by strict access controls. Only the people you invite into a group can see its balances, and we never hand that data to outside parties.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Do all group members need accounts?',
            answer: `Only people who want to view and interact with the group need accounts. Otherwise, if one person wants to track expenses for everyone, they can add anyone to splits without requiring anyone else to sign up. For receipt scanning, guests can claim items via a shared link without creating an account.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Who needs PayTogether Plus?',
            answer: `PayTogether Plus is perfect for power users who want enhanced personal features. Plus subscribers get receipt scanning, guest sharing with payment method links, flexible charge splitting for taxes and tips, unlimited favorites, detailed analytics, CSV exports, and advanced search and filter capabilities.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How does receipt scanning work?',
            answer: `A Plus subscriber uploads a receipt photo and the line items, taxes, tips, and totals are automatically extracted. In the receipt workspace, you configure how charges are split, then share links with group members or guests to claim their items. Once everyone has claimed, you finalize the receipt and PayTogether generates a single transaction reflecting what each person owes.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How do guests claim items on a receipt?',
            answer: `When you share a guest link, anyone with the link can view the receipt and claim items without signing up. They'll see their total and your payment methods (Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) so they know exactly how to pay you back. You can mark guests as paid and revoke links at any time.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How do charge splits work?',
            answer: `For each receipt, you can split taxes, gratuity, fees, and discounts in different ways: equally among all participants, proportionally based on subtotals, or with custom amounts per person. This gives you full control over how shared charges are allocated.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Does PayTogether support different currencies?',
            answer: `Yes! Each group has a home currency. Expenses and receipts scanned in a different currency are automatically converted using current exchange rates. The converted amounts appear alongside the original currency so everyone knows exactly what they owe.`
          },
          {
            question: 'What happens to my extra favorites if I leave Plus?',
            answer: `Your five most recently used favorites stay active. Any extras are safely stored and reactivate automatically if you're within the limit. Upgrade to Plus again and they'll all come back instantly.`
          },
          {
            question: 'Can I export my transactions?',
            answer: `Plus members can export group data to CSV, making it simple to run reports, share with other members, or archive history.`
          },
          {
            question: 'How do I get support?',
            answer: `Drop a note to <a href="mailto:support@paytogether.io">support@paytogether.io</a> and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.`
