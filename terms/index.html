          <div>
            <h2 id="terms-intro">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By creating an account, joining a group, or scanning a receipt, you agree to these Terms and our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. If you're using PayTogether for a club, household, or team, you confirm you have the authority to accept on their behalf.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>2. Who may use PayTogether</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old. If you are under 18, you need permission from a parent or guardian. You also need to be able to sign contracts in your home region.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>3. Your account</h2>
            <p>Keep your login credentials private. You're responsible for all activity that happens after you sign in, including guest links created from your groups and any payment methods you share. Let <a href="mailto:support@paytogether.io">support@paytogether.io</a> know right away if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>4. How PayTogether works</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Track expenses, split totals, and keep settle-up suggestions in one place.</li>
              <li>Scan receipts with our AI-powered workspace, configure how taxes, tips, fees, and discounts are split, and post a single transaction.</li>
              <li>Save favorites for expenses you recreate often. Nothing is posted automatically—you always confirm before submitting.</li>
              <li>Invite guests to claim their share of a receipt using a temporary access link. Links are revocable and tied to a single receipt session.</li>
              <li>Optionally share your saved payment methods (Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) with guests so they know how to pay you back.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>5. Receipt scanning &amp; AI output</h2>
            <p>Receipt images are stored securely and sent to third-party AI services to produce structured line items. The draft is for your convenience; you are responsible for verifying amounts, charge allocations, and participant assignments before posting the transaction. We may reject uploads that exceed size limits or violate our Acceptable Use rules.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>6. Charge splitting &amp; currency conversion</h2>
            <p>PayTogether lets you split taxes, gratuity, fees, and discounts equally, proportionally, or with custom amounts per person. You are responsible for ensuring the split configuration accurately reflects your group's agreement. When a receipt uses a different currency than your group's home currency, we display converted amounts using third-party exchange rates for convenience. Exchange rates are informational and may differ from rates offered by banks or payment processors.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>7. Payment method sharing</h2>
            <p>You may save payment handles (Venmo usernames, PayPal emails, Zelle phone numbers, etc.) to your profile and choose to share them with guests on a per-receipt basis. PayTogether displays these handles for informational purposes only and never initiates or processes payments. You are responsible for the accuracy of handles you save and for any arrangements made outside the app.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>8. Favorites instead of autoposting</h2>
            <p>Recurring expenses are handled via favorites and copy-from-history tools that you trigger manually. You are responsible for confirming amounts, splits, and participants every time.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>9. Subscriptions &amp; payments</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>PayTogether Plus is an auto-renewing subscription billed through the platform you subscribe on: Apple's App Store on iOS, Google Play on Android, or Stripe on the web. It renews automatically each billing cycle until you cancel.</li>
              <li>You can cancel anytime; access stays active until the current period ends. We don't issue prorated refunds for partial months.</li>
              <li>Subscription management and cancellation are handled through the platform you subscribed on: App Store settings on iOS, Google Play settings on Android, or your account on the web.</li>
              <li>Refund requests for purchases made through the App Store or Google Play must be directed to Apple or Google, respectively.</li>
              <li>If payment fails, we may suspend premium-only features (receipt uploads, higher limits) until the issue is resolved.</li>
              <li>Taxes may apply depending on your location. Prices may change with notice.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>10. Free trial</h2>
            <p>New subscribers may be eligible for a free trial of PayTogether Plus. During the trial you have full access to Plus features. If you don't cancel before the trial ends, your paid subscription begins automatically at the end of the trial period.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>11. Acceptable use</h2>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Upload receipts or notes that contain card numbers, bank logins, or other sensitive personal data that doesn't belong in an expense tracker.</li>
              <li>Use PayTogether for fraud, harassment, hate speech, or illegal activity.</li>
              <li>Reverse engineer, probe for vulnerabilities, or overload our APIs with scripted traffic.</li>
              <li>Misrepresent balances or impersonate another member.</li>
              <li>Share payment method handles that you don't own or aren't authorized to use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may suspend or delete accounts that break these rules or threaten platform integrity.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>12. Guest access responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Guest receipt links expose only the session you enable, but anyone holding the link can view it until you revoke it. If you share payment methods, guests will see those handles. Share links privately, monitor guest activity, mark guests as paid when appropriate, and disable access once claims are finalized. You are responsible for what your guests do with the data they receive.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>13. Settlements &amp; financial responsibility</h2>
            <p>PayTogether calculates who owes whom but never moves money and is not a payment service. Group members remain fully responsible for sending/receiving funds, complying with tax laws, and resolving disputes. Settle-up suggestions, payment method displays, and currency conversions are informational only.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>14. Data ownership</h2>
            <p>You own the data you add. You grant us a limited license to store, process, and display that data so the service can function. We may use aggregated, de-identified metrics (for example, total number of receipts processed) to improve the product.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>15. Beta and experimental features</h2>
            <p>Occasionally we launch opt-in experiments (like new receipt models or analytics). Beta tools may be unfinished, change quickly, or collect extra diagnostics so we can harden them. You can opt out anytime.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>16. Feedback</h2>
            <p>Suggestions or ideas you share can be used to improve PayTogether without compensation. Please don't send confidential information you expect us to keep secret.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>17. Service availability &amp; changes</h2>
            <p>We aim for 24/7 availability but outages and maintenance windows happen. Features may evolve or be discontinued. If we make a material change to these Terms, we'll notify you via email or an in-app banner.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>18. Termination</h2>
            <p>You can delete your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or create risk for other users. If that happens, we'll try to notify you using the email on file.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>19. Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>PayTogether is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We don't guarantee uninterrupted service, flawless AI extraction, accurate currency conversion rates, or that disputes between group members will be resolved automatically.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>20. Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, PayTogether will not be liable for indirect, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, even if we've been advised of the possibility. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount you paid (if any) in the six months before the claim arose.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>21. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PayTogether, its officers, and contractors from claims arising out of your use of the service, your data, or any violation of these Terms.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>22. Governing law</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes will be handled in the state or federal courts located in New Jersey.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>23. App Store &amp; platform terms</h2>

              <li><strong>Third-party beneficiary.</strong> Apple Inc. and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your use of PayTogether on iOS.
