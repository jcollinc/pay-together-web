            <p>PayTogether is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. We do our best to keep the app running smoothly, but we make no guarantees about:</p>

            <p>PayTogether is not a bank, payment processor, money transmitter, financial advisor, accounting service, legal or tax preparation tool, or a substitute for professional financial advice.</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verifying the accuracy of expense entries and calculations.</li>

              <li>Resolving disputes with other users.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, PayTogether and its operators are not liable for:</p>

          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>7. Disputes and Arbitration</h2>
            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
            <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>If we have a dispute, you and PayTogether agree to resolve it through binding arbitration rather than in court, except as noted below. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit and uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.</p>
            <p><strong>What Goes to Arbitration:</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to these Terms or PayTogether.</p>
            <p><strong>What Doesn’t:</strong> Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court, and either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property or unauthorized access issues.</p>
            <p><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You and PayTogether agree to resolve disputes only on an individual basis. You may not bring claims as a class member or consolidate your claim with others’ claims.</p>
            <p><strong>Arbitration Process:</strong> Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding. You can opt out of this arbitration agreement by emailing us at <a href="mailto:legal@paytogether.io">legal@paytogether.io</a> within 30 days of first using PayTogether.</p>
            <h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>If a dispute isn’t subject to arbitration, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts located in Delaware.</p>

            <h2>8. Service Changes and Termination</h2>
            <h3>Our Right to Modify</h3>

          <div>
            <h2>9. General Terms</h2>
            <p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and Refund and Cancellation Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and PayTogether.</p>
            <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.</p>
            <p><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision doesn’t waive that right or provision.</p>
            <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not transfer your rights under these Terms. We may assign our rights to a successor or affiliate.</p>

          <div>
            <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we’ll notify you via email or through a prominent notice in the app before the changes take effect. Your continued use of PayTogether after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
